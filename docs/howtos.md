!!! warning "Important"
    Don't lose your Mailio Emergency Kit. We don't store your passwords or private keys so restoring an account is impossible. Follow the backup instructions for your Emergency Kit. 

## Change your password

Once you're registered you may want to change your `Smart Key` password time to time. Smart Key is a part of `Mailio Emergency Kit` package. 

For changing your password you'll need:

1. Mailio Emergency Kit
2. Unzip the kit into a folder on your computer
3. Locate and open the file ending with `.pdf` (named something like `recovery_youremailalias@mail.io.pdf`)

The PDF document contains 24 backup words sometimes refered to them as `mnemonics`. 

Visit the Mailio recovery page: `https://mail.io/recovery`. 

Enter your 24 words as they appear in the PDF document and click `Next`. 

A popup will appear where you'll enter your email alias and choose a new password.

After completing the form click on `Download SmartKey`. Make sure your email alias matches the Smart Key.

!!! info "Please wait"
    Please give it a moment until your new Smart Key is created. A cryptographic function may take a bit longer depending on your computer. 

`Download SmartKey` button will change to `Finish` button after which Mailio installs your new SmartKey into a browser storage and redirects you to your Inbox.
